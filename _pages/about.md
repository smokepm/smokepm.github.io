I hold a M.A. in Quantitative Economics at California State University, Fullerton, with a concentration in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. My research focuses on applied econometrics, causal inference, and health policy analysis.

Currently, I serve as a Graduate Assistant at the Woods Center for Economic Analysis and Forecasting, where I contribute to regional economic forecasting models and the Orange County Economic Outlook Report.
