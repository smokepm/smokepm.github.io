## Master's Thesis

### The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Tobacco Use: A Staggered Difference-in-Difference Analysis
**Status**: Completed and Published

Analyzing the causal effects of state-level Medicaid expansion on smoking cessation and tobacco use patterns using BRFSS data from 2009-2023. Employing staggered difference-in-differences methods (Callaway & Sant'Anna) to account for heterogeneous treatment timing and effects.

**Methods**: Staggered DiD, Instrumental Variables (governor party affiliation), Panel Data Analysis  
**Data**: BRFSS (2009-2023), State Policy Databases  
**Tools**: R (fixest, did package), Stata, Python, SQL

**Key Research Questions**:
- How does Medicaid expansion affect smoking prevalence over time?
- What are the heterogeneous treatment effects across states and time periods?
- How do changes in market conditions within the tobacco industry affect smoking cessation rates among Medicaid enrollees?
